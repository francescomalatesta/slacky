# Slacky

_An easy-to-install, Lumen based invitation tool for your Slack team._

## Install

The keyword for this little project is "easy". All you will need to do is to execute:

    git clone https://github.com/francescomalatesta/slacky YourFolder
    cd YourFolder
    ./install

and nothing more.

If you have already added a Slack access token to your `.env` file, there's nothing more to do. 

Otherwise, you will be asked for it.

**Important:** if you don't know what an access token is, just generate it [on this page](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens).
